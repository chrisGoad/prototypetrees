# prototypetrees

This open-source repository contains the implementation of a new kind of JavaScript component: the prototype tree.
 
Prototypical inheritance is central to JavaScript. However, in normal practice, prototype structure is missing from stored (e.g, JSON) versions of objects. Prototype trees, however retain prototype structure when stored. [Here](https://protopedia.org) is a technical description.

Included here is an implementation of prototype trees representing 2d visual structures via SVG. 

A related project, [ProtoPedia](https://protopedia.org), is  an open diagramming system based on prototype trees, and consitututes a proof of concept for the technology.
