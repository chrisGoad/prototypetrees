# prototypetrees

This open-source repository contains the implementation of a new kind of JavaScript component: the prototype tree.
 
[Prototypical inheritance](https://protopedia.org/doc/inherit.html) is central to JavaScript. However, in normal practice, prototype structure is missing from stored (e.g, [JSON](https://www.json.org/)) versions of objects. Prototype trees, however retain prototype structure when stored. [Here](https://medium.com/dailyjs/prototype-trees-as-javascript-components-fad6c8fb4454) is a technical description.

Included here is an implementation of prototype trees representing 2d visual structures via SVG. 

A related project, [ProtoPedia](https://protopedia.org), is  an open diagramming system based on prototype trees, and consitututes a proof of concept for the technology.
